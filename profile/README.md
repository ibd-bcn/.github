# 🎉 Welcome to the IBD Barcelona lab GitHub!

This is where we share code and tools developed across our research projects — from data analysis pipelines to figure generation scripts.

Most of our work is focused on high-dimensional biological data, with a strong focus on FAIR principles. 

📁 Note: Datasets are not hosted here. Please refer to the relevant publication or reach out to us for access.
